# system-programming-lab
PLEASE READ!!!

This is a public repository, and I have no control over push, and pull
requests, commits, merges, etc.

in order for us to be able to upload our own solution, testers, and so on,
and to be able to read others, please take the following actions, and
steps before attempting to upload your code to the repository.

--------------------------- ACTIONS TO TAKE ---------------------------

1.	If you have any doubts, and are not sure how to work with git
	in a way that doesnt risk removing other people's files, overwriting their
	code, etc. Then PLEASE, ask for help and guidance before using,
	and running tests on your own at the price of damaging the work
	of other students.
	
2.	after pulling the repository, before adding new files, please
	use the command "git checkout -b name_of_the_branch_you_wish_to_create"
	to create a new branch, and then swap to it.
	
3.	if you wish to add your files, push the new branch you created and then
	merge it into main. 

4.	PLEASE DO NOT WORK ON BRANCH MAIN - Working on branch main may overwrite
	other people's code, remove files, and cause other unpleasantness.
	make sure you are on your own branch before commiting changes.
	
5.	please only edit your own files. If you wish to edit other people's
	files copy them to a different directory that is not related to this 
	repository and work on it there to avoid making changes to other people's
	files when merging branches.
