******************************** Hello And Welcome! ********************************
This is a text validation program.
The program's function is to validate proper nesting of brackets within a given input
If you are using this program from CMD or Terminal, you can stop this program at any point
by using the keyboard combination Ctrl+Z for Windows CMD or Ctrl+D for Terminal
This program can validate an infinite number of lines. Yet, the length of each seperate line
must be no longer than a 100 characters, or else, only the first 100 will be scanned.

In order to begin the validation, please provide a line of input...
