Well, it is a square... But it sure ain't a magical one...
This is due to the following reasons:
	# You have provided a value that is not within the scope of {1...N^2}.
	# The square has one or more rows/columns with an invalid sum.
 		all sums should be equal to: 65.
	# The square has one or more diagonals with an invalid sum.
 		all sums should be equal to: 65.
